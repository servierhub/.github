# Servier Open Source Hub
[![Servier Powered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/servierhub/.github/main/badges/powered.svg)](https://servier.com/en/)

Welcome to the [Servier](https://servier.com/en/) Hub.
This initiative showcases [Open Source software, contributed, inspired or built by Servier and its people](https://github.com/topics/servier).

## Why open sourcing some of our software?
At Servier, we believe in [Open Innovation](https://servier.com/en/research-innovation/open-innovation/) as the best way to meet patient needs through collaboration and constant dialogue between those involved in health care in both the public and private sectors.

Beyond scientific research, [Digital, Data and Information Systems are also a key element of our innovation and transformation](https://servier.com/en/newsroom/digital-data-pillars-transformation/).

So open source and the people behind it are a natural way of fostering a technological culture.

**We love "tech" and we value our tech people!**

## How to submit your project to the Servier Hub?
